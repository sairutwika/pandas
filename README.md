# 🎬 Movies Dataset Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of 1000 movies using Python and Pandas. The dataset contains details such as movie names, genres, release years, IMDb ratings, and revenue. The analysis includes filtering data based on genres and years, calculating statistics, and ranking movies based on ratings.

## 📌 Features

- Load and process a dataset from an Excel file.  
- Filter movies by genre, release year, and IMDb rating.  
- Perform statistical operations like count, mean, and sum.  
- Rank movies based on IMDb ratings.  
- Sort movies by different attributes like release year and revenue.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Recommended IDE)  

## 📂 Dataset Columns

- `Movie Name` - Name of the movie  
- `Genre` - Genre category (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama)  
- `Release_Year` - Year of release  
- `IMDb_Rating` - IMDb rating score (out of 10)  
- `Revenue` - Earnings in million dollars
